		<h3>Catholic Christianity</h3>
		<p>Catholicism is the major religion of Western Europe. After each start date, it has a tendency to progress further east, and is almost always one of the most successful religions in the game.<br>
Catholicism is one of the major instigators of the Great Schism. The Great Schism was a separation of the original Nicene Church after a prolonged rivalry between the Roman Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, culminating in them excommunicating each other shortly before the "High Middle Ages" game start (in 1054).<br>
The religious head for Catholicism is the Pope, but it is not uncommon for one or more Antipopes to form throughout the game.</p>
