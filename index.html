	 <h2>Christianity</h2>
	 <p>Christianity is one of the 6 religious groups represented inCrusader Kings II, and the only group playable without paid expansions (though its mechanics are expanded by Dlc Sons of Abraham).<br>
The second of the Abrahamic religions, Christianity arose from the teachings of Yeshua of Nazereth, a Jewish carpenter commonly called by his Greek name Jesus, whom Christians believe to be the literal Son of God. Though Jesus was crucified in approximately 30 AD on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, the faith he founded would ultimately supplant Hellenic paganism as the state religion of the Roman Empire following its legalization by Emperor Constantine I in 313. By the time of Crusader Kings II, Christianity is the dominant religion in Western and Central Europe, as well as in the Byzantine Empire and East Africa, and its reach continues to expand in later start dates by the conversion of West Asian pagans and the Spanish <i>Reconquista.</i><br>
There are four groups of Christians present in CKII: Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Miaphysitism (also known as Copticism), and Nestorianism.</p>

	<article>
		<h3>Catholic Christianity</h3>
		<p>Catholicism is the major religion of Western Europe. After each start date, it has a tendency to progress further east, and is almost always one of the most successful religions in the game.<br>
Catholicism is one of the major instigators of the Great Schism. The Great Schism was a separation of the original Nicene Church after a prolonged rivalry between the Roman Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, culminating in them excommunicating each other shortly before the "High Middle Ages" game start (in 1054).<br>
The religious head for Catholicism is the Pope, but it is not uncommon for one or more Antipopes to form throughout the game.</p>
		<h4>Holy Sites</h4>
		<p>
-Rome: The seat of the Pope and historical capital of the Western Roman Empire.<br>
-Santiago: The site of the tomb of St. James the Great, one of the Twelve Apostles of Christ.
-KÃ¶ln: The site of the Shrine of the Three Kings, a reliquary said to contain the bones of the three wise men from the East who visited the young Christ in the Gospels.<br>
-Jerusalem: Holy to all Abrahamic faiths, Jerusalem is the historical seat of the Jewish faith and the site where Christ was executed and rose from the dead.<br>
-Kent: The Archbishopric of Canterbury is of great importance in British Christianity from antiquity into the Renaissance. Among other things, it was the see of St. Thomas Becket, who was murdered by followers of King Henry II Plantagenet in 1170 AD (the infamous "turbulent priest" incident, emblematic of the tension between secular and clerical rulers in Catholicism).<br>
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Eastern Orthodox Christianity</h3>
		<p>Eastern Orthodoxy is the religion of the Byzantine Empire and several of its neighbors. In 1066, it is also the religion of the Rurikid rulers (Rus-Ruthenia region).<br>
The Byzantine Empire is by far the most powerful Orthodox ruler in most start dates. However, its rule is often challenged by heresy (notably Iconoclasty in 769) and powerful Muslim rulers.<br>
The religious head of Eastern Orthodoxy is the Ecumenical Patriarch, usually residing in Constantinople. However, he only has jurisdiction over characters and provinces not already under pentarchs and autocephalous patriarchs. Most of the time, the Ecumenical Patriarch is also the Pentarch of Constantinople, and a vassal of the Byzantine Empire.</p>
		<h4>Holy Sites</h4>
		<p>
-Constantinople: The historical seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Emperor Constantine's capital. Constantine is venerated as a saint by Orthodoxy and by Byzantine Catholics.<br>
-Jerusalem<br>
-Antioch: Referred to as the "Cradle of Christianity" and the place where the word "Christian" first emerged.<br>
-Ephesus: An important center of early Christianity.<br>
-Mount Athos: The heart of Eastern monasticism.
